This demo show a build system which is able to do
1. automatic dependency generation (I.E. if you modify a header used by X amount of C files, those files are built again)
2. a seperate build folder (so cleaning is as simple as rm -rf build , and no object code pollutes your source tree)
3. makes a ELF that contains all code that will go into the main code segment.
4. automatic compilation of host-side tools to use during the build process

The actual code used here is from "polyline", though it should be very easy to use your own code in the build system without too much trouble.

If you need help understanding some parts, don't hesitate to ask
