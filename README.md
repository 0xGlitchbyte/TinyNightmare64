# n64 modern 3D render test
#

this is a fork of N64_3DRenderingTest

https://github.com/tffdev/N64_3DRenderingTest

it contains the source files to build a Nintendo 64 rom that displays 3D models

though it compiles, the resulting rom is not curently working on original hardware

i've only tested on Ubuntu 

you need to have modern-n64sdk installed
