 * The "output_buff" field of the RCP task structure is set to this address.
 * It is placed in its own .c, and thus its own .o, since the linker aligns
 * individual relocatables to data cache line size (16 byte) boundaries.
 *
 * This avoids the problem where the output buffer data is accidentally
 * scribbled over during a writeback for data sharing the same line.
