* om_game_main.c
   When a game gets cleared, data->time_cnt, the amount of
   time to return to the title, would not be initialized.
   This variable gets initialized in the om_game_stage_clear
   function now.

* om_audio.c
   Fixed some code in the 
   om_stage_cleartime_check_and_music_tempo_change function; it 
   had problems when NUALSTL's had not been defined.

* expad.c
   Removed dummycontrollerdata since it's been defined but
   not been used.

1999/7/16

* Makefile.sgi*
   Fixed so that warning messages would not come up. Also fixed
   a problem where some files would not be deleted when using
   make clean.

* om_mychar.c
   Removed some variables that are not currently used.

* om_cornfrake.c
   Added error routines so that the warning message for the return
   value of om_cornfrake_display_check would not be displayed.


1999/6/4

* mainproc in main.c

   Fixed it so a callback is not registered in every frame.
   Created a new state called OM_STANDBY.  The process goes here  
   when the state does not change.

* mainproc in main.c

   Deleted a wasteful local variable.
   The local variable seq_no is no longer used.  Instead,  
   om_program_seq_st.seq_no is used.

* gfxWaitSync in gfx.c

   Ended wasteful waiting for frames.
   This function is called at every retrace, so we deleted the  
   call to nuGfxRetraceWait(1)

* Include/om.h

   Macro definition for newly created state OM_STANDBY 

* om_system_init in main.c

   Debug console is now clearly ON.
